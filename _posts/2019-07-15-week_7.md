This week required a lot of thinking before jumping to code the stuff. Interested? Okay move on to next paragraph.

Basically, I worked on three PRs, [#17163](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17163) for continuous time Markov chains, [#17174](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17174) for random matrices and [#17146](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17146) for symbolic Ranges. The first and the last PRs are very much intensive. I developed a new algorithm for the query handler of `ContinuousMarkovChain.probability` method, because the previous one which I implemented in `DiscreteMarkovChain.probability`, was not easy to maintain, quite ad-hoc, rigid and difficult to extend. The philosophy behind the algorithm is recursion i.e., boil everything down to `Relational` query, convert them to sets and then calculate the probability. You can find the complete description [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17163#issuecomment-510939984). I am waiting for any critical objections from my mentors and after that I will refactor the code as suggested by [oscarbenjamin](https://github.com/oscarbenjamin) and [jksuom](https://github.com/jksuom). So, now let's move on to random matrices. As it was to be implemented from scratch, it required a bit of thinking to reach a decent architecture. Currently, the PR is at a basic level, and some more testing is to be done. Now, coming on to symbolic `Range`. Let me tell you, it requires a lot of logical thinking to make `Range` accept symbolic parameters. A lot of tests fail, and a lot of debugging has to be done to make a method work. In fact, we might deprecate `xrange` support from `Range` because we are going to drop `Python 2` support from `SymPy`.

This week I learnt to combine the concepts from algorithms and software engineering to develop the stuff I mentioned above. This was the best week of my overall GSoC experience till now.

A lot more lies ahead. Bye!!
