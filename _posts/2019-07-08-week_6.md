This week was a mix of discussion on design and extending previous work. I also got to know about some new cool features of `SymPy`.

According to the plan proposed in [Week 4](https://czgdp1807.github.io/week_4/), I have completed my work on `DiscreteMarkovChain` via [PR #17083](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17083). I used the `as_set` and `as_relational` methods which helped me to cover many miscellaneous cases and probably, now `DiscreteMarkovChain` is quite dynamic and can handle various generic `probability` and `expectation` queries. I have also started the [PR #17163](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17163) for adding `ContinuousMarkovChain` and I am observing that it's a bit tricky to maintain both the performance and result quality while working on it. Now, moving on to symbolic `Range`,well, the work has been started in the [PR #17146](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17146) and I have figured out one disparity between `Range` and python's `range`(details available at [this thread](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17146#discussion_r300162219)). I will try to fix it by making minimal changes to the code. The tensorflow related [PR #17103](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17103) which I started in the previous week is also almost complete and is waiting for `Tensorflow 2.0` release. I am also studying a bit about the architecture of the above framework to make changes to `lambdify`. Regarding random matrices, I believe that discussion has reached its final stages and I am waiting for the comments from Francesco for improvements at the issue [#17039](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/issues/17039).

Let me share with you about my discoveries and learnings in this week. Well, thanks to Francesco for telling me about, `sympy.multipledispatch`. It helps in implementing operator overloading like in C/C++. I liked it very much. I also read about continuous Markov chain and discovered about generator matrix, forward and backward equations. Adding one interesting fact, that Poisson process and continuous Markov chain are very closely related via generator matrices it will make the implementation of the former much easier :D.

Leaving you for now, Bye!!
