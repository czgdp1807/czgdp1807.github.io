1. Existence of dataset generators which are capable of generating data distributions other than what the model has been trained on i.e., capable of producing dataset shift. For example, using summation properties of integration. To prove that infinite types of dataset generators are possible.
2. This model will give results even for those functions which don't have any closed form integral.
3. The model should be trained over expressions containing `*` and `/` operators, because expressions containing `+` and `-` can be evaluated by applying `+` and `-` over the result of args of respective operators. There is no need for trigonometric operators as all of them can be expressed in terms of exponential operators. See, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_using_Euler%27s_formula for more details.
4. Making the model independent of different underlying distributions of various datasets.

First limit the length of the expression. Limit the number of operators in an expression by converting trigonometric operators to exponential operators. Train the model to integrate only `*` and `/` expressions. For inference divide the expression into arguments of `+` and `-` and then sum the results accordingly.
