Hi. This was my last week of coding in GSoC, 2021 and hence, my last blog for GSoC as I won't be able to participate as a student in future versions. I worked on completing `ImplicitDeallocate` node. Adding this node at the of each function, subroutine was easy. However, adding it just before function and subroutine calls is a bit hard. There are several corner cases to cover. I will keep working on this and will try to get it in, in the coming days. Anyways, that's all. Thanks for following this series of blog posts. I will come up with a final report containing a list of my open, closed and merged MRs. Bye until then.
