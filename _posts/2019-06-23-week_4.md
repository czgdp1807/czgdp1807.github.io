So, with the fourth week, the first phase of my journey with `SymPy` has come to an end. This blog post summarises the work done till now, in terms of PRs. Moreover, I will share with you the plans for phase 2.

I worked on the following PRs(listed in chronological order) during the first phase, many of them got merged and few are open.

**Merged**

- [#16528](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16528) : I worked on extending the `GumbelDistribution` to  support both minimum and maximum versions of it.

- [#16576](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16576): This PR added `Dirichlet` and `MultivariteEwens` distributions.

- [#16808](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16808) : This PR added `Multinomial` and `NegativeMultinomial` distribution.

- [#16810](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16810) : This PR improved the API of `Sum` by allowing `Range` as the limits.

- [#16825](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16825) : This PR in continuation, added `GeneralizedMultivariateLogGamma` distribution. This was an interesting one due to the complexity involved in its PDF.

- [#16834](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16834) : This PR enhanced the `Multinomial` and `NegativeMultinomial` distributions by allowing symbolic dimensions for them.

- [#16897](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16897) : This was related to `sympy.core` and it helped in removing disparity in the results of special function `gamma`.

- [#16899](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16899) : This was a workflow related to PR to ignore the `.vscode` folder.

- [#16908](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16908) : This PR improved `sympy.stats.frv` by allowing conditions with foriegn symbols.

- [#16913](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16913) : This removed the unreachable code from `sympy.stats.frv`.

- [#16914](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16914) : This PR allowed symbolic dimensions to `MultivariateEwens` distribution.

- [#16929](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16929) : This one was for the `sympy.tensor` module. It optimized the `ArrayComprehension` and covered some corner cases.

- [#16981](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16981) : This PR added the architecture of stochastic processes. It also added discrete Markov chain to `sympy.stats`.

- [#17003](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17003) : This PR ignored the `__pycahce__` folder by adding it `.gitignore` file.

- [#17030](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17030) : Some features like, `joint_dsitribution` were added in this PR.

- [#17046](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17046) : Some common properties of discrete Markov chains, like fundamental matrix, fixed row vector were added.

**Open**

- [#16962](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16962) : The aim of this PR is to allow symbolic dimensions to single finite distributions, like `Die`, `Binomial`. The work from my side is complete on this.

- [#16934](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16934) : This PR aims to fix the bugs and test the code introduced in `GSoC` 2018.


Apart from the above PRs I also reviewed code written by other contributors.
Overall, according to me phase 1 was a great learning and working experience.

Let me share with you my plan for phase 2. Since, I will be working on random matrices during the upcoming phase, I have started the discussions for design with my mentors and things are taking shape. However, apart from random matrices, I will also work on few more general improvements for my phase 1 work.

The outline is given below,

1. I will work on extending the scope of queries handeled by discrete Markov chains by covering some uncommon cases.

2. Some work will be done to extend the `DiscreteMarkovChain` by adding `ContinuousMarkovChain` as the latter is almost same but with some extra parameters.

3. I will implement random matrices and its various Gaussian ensembles according to the conclusion of the design discussions.

4. Last but not the least, I will try to merge my open PRs.

Thanks for reading and see you soon in phase 2. Bye!!
