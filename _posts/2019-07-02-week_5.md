The evaluation results for phase 1 are out, and I am very glad to share with you that I have passed with flying colors. I received, "Well done so far." as the feedback for my work till now.

So now let us move to the work done in the gap between phase 1 and phase 2. Firstly, both of my open PRs of the previous phase, i.e., [#16962](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16962) and [#16934](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16934) have been merged. Though for symbolic dimensions some more work has to be done to make `sympy.stats.frv` more efficient and maintainable. I have also started my work, PR [#17083](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17083), to extend the scope of queries for `DiscreteMarkovChain` and the system has become a bit smarter. In fact, during this week, while working on the PR, [#17103](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17103), I came across the news that Tensorflow has changed a lot of APIs  while migrating from 1.x to 2.x. AFAIK, they are moving towards `Function` approach from the previous `Session` approach, and due to that, SymPy's `lambdify` faced some issues which I will be fixing soon with the help of other members. The Tensorflow details can be seen [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/b1d83bf2ee3fc72650140b89656e29932db36226/rfcs/20180918-functions-not-sessions-20.md).

Now, let's move to the learning part. During the transition period I learnt about the dependencies of `SymPy`. Moreover, I came across, how, some bugs can be unnoticed when left untested. Thanks again to [oscarbenjamin](https://github.com/oscarbenjamin) for letting me know about the bugs related to variance of finite random variables. I also got to know that, how bare `except` can even catch keyboard interrupt and that's what makes it quite vulnerable. Thanks to [sidhantnagpal](https://github.com/sidhantnagpal) for helping me with this.

So, that's all for this, see you next week. Bye!!
