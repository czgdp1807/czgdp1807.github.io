I am very happy to share with you that on 6th May, 2019 I was accepted as a
GSoC student of [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/). I would be working on statistics module under the guidance
of my mentors, [Francesco Bonazzi](https://github.com/Upabjojr) and [Sidhant Nagpal](https://github.com/sidhantnagpal).

I know Francesco since I began contributing to stats module. We had discussions
on various issues like, complicated results by statistics module and inclusion
of stochastic processes in SymPy. I also worked with Sidhant while solving an
issue of wrong PDF of Gumbel distribution. I believe that they both are very great
people to learn from.

I will also work with Ritesh Kumar who has also been accepted to stats module. I
haven't interacted with him yet. Let's see how we coordinate our work to make this
project a success.

Infact, my first learning experience was using jekyll to set up this blog on github
pages. Since, this was my first usage of jekyll and github pages, I struggled a bit to find
the right resource. If you are also going to use jekyll then I would say, visit [this page](https://help.github.com/en/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).
