As the title suggests, with the third phase, the journey of my GSoC 2019 comes to an end. It was full of challanges, learning experiences, and above all interaction with the open source community of `SymPy`.
In this blog post I will share with you the work done between phase 2 and phase 3, in terms of PRs, merged and open.

**Merged**

- [#17174](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17174) : In this PR, Gaussian ensembles were added to `sympy.stats`.

- [#17304](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17304) : While working on the above PR, I got an idea to open this one to add cicular ensembles to `sympy.stats`. I learned a lot about Haar measure while working on this.

- [#17306](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17306): This PR added matrices with random expressions. The challenging part of this PR was to generate canonical results for passing the tests.

- [#17336](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17336) : This was related to bug fix in `Q.ask` and `Matrix`. Take a look at an example [here](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17336#issue-304058013).

**Open**

- [#17387](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17387) : This PR aims to add support for assumptions of dependence among random variables, like, `Covariance`, etc.

- [#17146](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17146) : This PR is in its last stages to fix and upgrade the `Range` set and we are finalizing few things, like changes in the output of `Range`. As planned I was successful at writing exhaustive and systematic tests.

Well, now, time to say good bye! It was a nice experience writing about journey in this blog. If you have read this from the beginning then thanks a lot buddy, and I wish for your acceptance in GSoC 2020. Keep Open Sourcing :D
