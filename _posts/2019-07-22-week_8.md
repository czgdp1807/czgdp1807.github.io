With the 8th week, the second phase of my project is complete and we are heading towards the end of GSoC 2019.
This blog post summarises the work done between phase 1 and phase 3, in terms of PRs. Moreover, I will share with you my plans for the last phase.

I worked on the following PRs(listed in chronological order) during the second phase, some of them got merged and few are open.

**Merged**

- [#16934](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16934) : The bug fixes were complete and the further work has been handed over to my co-student, Ritesh.

- [#16962](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/16962) : This was continuation of the work done in phase 1 for allowing symbolic dimensions in finite random variables. As I planned, this PR got merged in phase 2, after some changes.

- [#17083](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17083): The work done in this PR framed the platform and reason for the next one. The algorithm that got merged was a bit difficult to extend, and maintain. Thanks to Francesco for his [comment](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17083#issuecomment-508256359) for motivating me to re-think the whole framework.

- [#17163](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17163) : This was one of the most challenging PRs of the project till now, because, it involved re-designing the algorithm, refactoring the code and moreover lot of thinking. The details can be found at [this comment](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17163#issuecomment-510939984).

**Open**

- [#17174](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17174) : This PR aims at adding random matrices to sympy. Currently, I am studying about the expressions involving random matrices and computing their densities.

- [#17146](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/17146) : This PR aims at allowing symbolic parameters to `Range`. The work is complete and I am waiting for final reviews. Hopefully it gets merged.


Apart from the above PRs I also reviewed code written by other contributors.
Overall, according to me phase 2 was a great learning and logical experience.

Let me share with you the outline of my plan for phase 3.

The outline is given below,

1. I will work on enhancing the result generation by the stats module as was planned in the beginning.

2. The work on random matrices will be extended and I will add more features to them.

3. Probably, if time permits, I will try to do some more refactoring of `sympy.stats.frv`, and will try to add some more stochastic processes.

4. I will also try to merge my open PRs.

Thanks for reading and see you soon in phase 3. Bye!!
